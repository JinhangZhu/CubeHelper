## TBD

- OLL, PLL algorithms... (planned ddl: 2021/08/01 I guess)
- Timer for answering the blanks (planned ddl: 2021/08/10 I guess)
- Can choose test set from multiples (planned ddl: 2021/08/30)
- Algorithm set without images, i.e. pure data in text (planned ddl: 2021/09/30)
- Multiple solutions (don't really wanna do this, so planned ddl: 2021/12/31 and the item might be canceled)
- **Suggestions are welcomed!**
